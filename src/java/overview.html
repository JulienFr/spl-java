<p>Performance-based adaptation framework for Java.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this framework is to allow applications adapt their behaviour
based on their current or past performance.
The framework allows the developer to express the performance questions
in an elegant way through SPL &mdash; Stochastic Performance Logic &mdash;
and the framework offers the possibilities to manually
insert performance probes or to automatically instrument already running
bytecode.
The SPL allows to capture the assumptions in a straightforward manner
yet it uses robust statistical testing to give the best results.
The implementation tries to minimize the overhead.
</p>
<p>
An example of performance-aware application follows.
Imagine a web application that generates a plot displaying some values
over time, such as air temperature over last few days.
The rendering takes some time and is faster when there are less data to
display.
The question that arises is: how much data to display?
On one side of the equation is the user who wants the data rendered as
precisely as possible, on the other side is the performance of the server
that limits number of processed requests.
</p>
<p>
The SPL framework aims to solve this challenge without too much of extra
work.
It is rather simple to imagine the solution written maually.
The rendering method would measure its duration time and the time would
be compared either with absolute value or with average over last few
minutes.
If the time required to render the plot would grow, lower resolution
(less data) plot would be rendered.
The naive approach has few drawbacks.
Among them is poor maintanability as the developer needs to edit the source
code and a lot of boiler plate code that captures the actual condition.
Furthermore, there are additional challenges on the statistical side of
the problem, such as filtering of the outliers or parameter tunning.
</p>
<p>
With SPL, the developer can focus solely on the adaptation logic and leave
other things to the framework.
Below is such example, the quality of the image is here determined by the
system load.
</p>
<pre class="syntax java">
public class PlotRendering implements HttpHandler {
	private Formula machineIdle;
	
	public PlotRendering() {
		/*
		 * Create the formula - the boundary is 0.2 of
		 * system load. The word load serves as a variable
		 * to be assigned to later.
		 */
		machineIdle = SplFormula.create("load &lt; 0.2");
		
		/*
		 * Now we assing the variable "load" the value of
		 * current system load. No evaluation is done at the
		 * moment.
		 */
		machineIdle.bind("load", SystemLoad.INSTANCE);
	}
	
	&#x40;Override
	public void handle(HttpExchange exchange) throws IOException {
		DataTable values = null;
		
		/*
		 * The function evaluate queries the provider binded
		 * earlier - in this case the system load - for the
		 * most up-to-date data and evaluates them.
		 * If the formula holds, the system is probably idle
		 * and we would serve full image. Otherwise, more
		 * approximate data would be used.
		 */
		if (machineIdle.evaluate() == Result.TRUE) {
			values = DataToVisualize.getDaily();
		} else {
			values = DataToVisualize.getWeekly();
		}
		
		/*
		 * Code for rendering the graph and sending the
		 * response is omitted.
		 */
	}
}
</pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Although the framework tries to be as intuitive as possible, short
explanation how to use it is probably necessary.
The framework can be internally divided into several parts that can be
(partially) used separately.
More information is provided as documentation for individual
classes/interfaces.
</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>
<p>
Data sources that represent input data fed into SPL formulas.
Typically, these input data are derived from method execution times but they
can also represent system load or network round-trip-time.
</p>
<p>
Data source is represented by the {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.core.Data}
interface.
Usually, method execution times would be stored in an array-like structure,
backed, for example, by {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.stock.PlainBufferDataSource}.
</p>
<p>
The framework by itself provides {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.stock.SystemLoad}
representing current system load.
</p>

<h3>Formulas</h3>
<p>
Formulas are the heart of the framework.
They use the Stochastic Performance Logic to express assumptions/questions
about application performance.
They are represented by the {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.core.Formula} interface.
</p>
<p>
Although one can use implementation from {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.formula}
to build the formula, it is easier to express the formula as a string and
parse it with {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.formula.SplFormula#create}.
</p>
<p>
Individual variables in the formula must always be binded to concrete data
sources prior formula evaluation.
This allows you to reuse to formula with different data sources
(e.g. modeled performance vs. actually measured performance).
Different interpretation of the formula can be used as well
(see {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.core.MathematicalInterpretation}).
</p>

<h3>Probes</h3>
<p>
{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.core.Probe} is the place where data are collected.
The probes can either created manually or inserted automatically.
The automatically created probes are accompanied by probe controllers
(@{link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.core.ProbeController}) that can be used
to activate them or deactivate them.
</p>

<h3>Instrumentation utilities</h3>
<p>
Sometimes, the developer can place the probes manually into the source code.
But often it is much simpler to instrument the bytecode without touching
the source code (that may not be available at all).
For such situations, the framework offers few utilities to add measuring
code to existing bytecode.
The instrumentation is controlled by
{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.core.ProbeController}
that is constructed based on user needs.
There are several controller builders available in
{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.probe}.
They allow the developer to specify when the data are supposed to be collected
(via the {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.core.InvocationFilter})
or how the data shall be stored
(via the {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.core.MeasurementConsumer}).
