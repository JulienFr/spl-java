# Performance-based adaptation framework for Java

SPL for Java is a performance-based adaptation framework.
The purpose of this framework is to allow applications adapt their behaviour
based on their current or past performance.

## Requirements

To compile and run the framework, the following software has to be available
on your machine.

* Java SDK >= 1.7.0
* Apache Ant

## Compilation

The compilation is driven by Apache Ant, the target `agent` will build the
Java agent with the framework that you can attach to your application.

When compiling, set the javacc property of the build.properties to the right path value of your javac compiler.

Executing target `test` will run the provided unit tests, the generated
report is in `out/test-results/html/index.html`.

## Documentation

... is not very detailed at the moment.

Running `ant refdoc` will generate JavaDoc documentation with basic information
on how to use SPL for Java
(into `out/javadoc/index.html`).

SPL was originally created for performance unit testing, more information
is available at [SPL for Java page](http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/software/spl-java)
